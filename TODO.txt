1: Redo reward system.
    Currently fine for making spells, but doesn't work for much else. The display is
    fine since everything will need name + image + description.

    -Reward system needs-
    1 A choose button that works for ALL types of things
    2 A way of determining what type of thing to give as choices
    3 A way of determining what power level to give as choices

    -Things that need to be decided on-
    4 Can multiple types of things be given as choices at once? (ie: spells AND upgrades)
    5 What types of upgrades for spells?
    6 Ratio of new spells to upgrades
    7 Ratio of infinite upgrades to unique upgrades

2: Update UI to include names (they all already have names anyway)

3: Create spellbook and allow moving of abilities
    Once the spellbook is finished we can have as many spell rewards as we want,
    rather than only 9 or whatever.
    
    -Spellbook needs-
    1 Pages
        This might be a little more complicated, but I don't think it's going to be *that*
        hard
    2 Icons of the spells with their name next to it
    3 Ability to move spells from it to your hotbar

    -Things that need to be decided on-
    4 How big is the spellbook (how much of the screen does it take up)
    5 Do the icons go "where do you want to put it?" or do you just drag them

4: Finish creating upgrades of every ability.

-----------------DECISIONS-------------------
=============================================
1-3: Making rarities for each upgrade could work, but I think it would have to be
    implemented in a different way than the current spell cardpool works (which tbh we
    might want to look at anyway).

1-4: I think that giving multiple things at once *could* work well, but makes it harder to
    finetune how the game feels. Unique upgrades are incredibly strong, being able to
    offer them at benchmarks instead of randomly seems like a better idea than
    just having them come in randomly. Getting none or getting only them sounds unfun.

    On the other hand, we could hold back *specifically* unique upgrades until specific
    waves or intervals.
    
    I think that having a chance to find a new spell that decreases the more spells you
    have is a good idea, with infinite upgrades being when you don't find one. Unique
    upgrades can be chosen on specific intervals but the player will have much more
    say in which one they get (so they can make a build easier).

3-4 Probably close to a full screen horizontally, definitely leave open the bottom
3-5 Drag, having it completely centered around the mouse cursor when doing so. If the mouse
    is released in a new slot, it goes there. At the moment it cannot go into multiple slots.
